# TaskHero — 3 Minute Pitch Script

> **Total time:** 3 min talking + 1 min live demo after Slide 4
> **Pace:** Confident, punchy, no filler. You're not pitching an idea — you're presenting a deployed product.

---

## SLIDE 1 — Title (15 sec)

**[Walk up. Pause. Make eye contact.]**

> "How many of you have sent a message in a Telegram group asking for help with something — buying food, finding a tutor, selling your old iPad — and it just... got buried?"
>
> "That's the problem. And this — is **Task Hero**."
>
> "A live, deployed app. Not a prototype. Not a Figma mockup. You can open it on your phone right now — **taskhero-sutd.web.app**."

---

## SLIDE 2 — The Problem (25 sec)

> "Campus life creates constant micro-needs. Every single day. But there is **zero** infrastructure to serve them."
>
> "We polled 97 students and 54 staff. **98%** of students said Telegram is overbloated — their requests drown in noise. **95%** of staff said they can't reach the right audience. Emails don't get read."
>
> "Think about that. Almost every person on this campus has a need they can't efficiently fulfill. And almost every person on this campus is willing to help — **if only they knew someone needed it**."

---

## SLIDE 3 — The Market (20 sec)

> "So we ran the numbers. Yesterday. On this campus."
>
> "**1,000** students. **98%** facing unmet micro-needs. **670** pending tasks per week if you map out what people actually need. That's over **$6,000** in latent demand — **every single week** — just at SUTD."
>
> "Now imagine NUS. NTU. SMU. **40,000 students across Singapore.** This is not a side project. This is a market waiting for structure."

---

## SLIDE 4 — The Solution (20 sec)

> "Task Hero. **Powered by AI. Built for community.**"
>
> "The concept is dead simple. **Post a Task. A Hero grabs it. They get paid. That's it.**"
>
> "Three things make us different. **Micro Need** — we cater to everyone, for everything. From buying kopi to finding a co-founder. **10 seconds** — that's how fast you go from idea to posted task, thanks to AI. And **Tidy** — clean, intuitive, no learning curve."
>
> "But don't take my word for it. Let me show you."

## 🖥️ LIVE DEMO (1 min)

**[Switch to taskhero-sutd.web.app on your phone/laptop]**

**Demo flow (practice this to 60 seconds exactly):**

1. **Login** — "One-click Google Sign-In. You're in." *(3 sec)*
2. **Dashboard** — "Live stats. Active missions. Weekly activity. All real-time from Firestore." *(5 sec)*
3. **Post Task (VOICE)** — Hit record, say: *"I need someone to buy me a chicken rice from the canteen, I'm in Building 2 level 5"* → Stop → Show Deepgram transcribing → Show AI formatting → **"10 seconds. From voice to a fully structured task."** *(25 sec)*
4. **Browse** — "Every task is live. Filter by category, sort by price. Heroes pick what they want." *(7 sec)*
5. **Task Detail** — Click a task → "Both parties see live progress. Real-time. No refresh. Poster and Hero are always in sync." *(10 sec)*
6. **Post it** — Click Post Task → "And it's live. Right now. On a deployed app that anyone on this campus can use **today**." *(10 sec)*

## SLIDE 5 — Product Screenshot (10 sec)

> "What you just saw isn't a demo environment. That **is** the product. Flutter web, deployed on Firebase Hosting, running OpenAI and Deepgram in production."
>
> "Every screen you saw is powered by 7 live Firestore streams. Every interaction is real."

---

## SLIDE 6 — Competitive Position (15 sec)

> "Now — why not just use what exists? WhatsApp, Telegram, Fiverr, Carousell?"
>
> "Those platforms weren't built for campus. Fiverr is for freelancers. Carousell is for selling stuff. Telegram is for chatting. **None of them structure micro-needs. None of them use AI to format your request. None of them give you real-time task tracking between two parties on the same campus.**"
>
> "Task Hero takes what's scattered across four platforms and puts it in one purpose-built place."

---

## SLIDE 7 — Traction & Feedback (15 sec)

> "We've already tested this. Voice-to-posted task — **under 10 seconds**. Top categories from our user tests: Food & Delivery, Academic Help, and Errands. Exactly what you'd expect on a campus."
>
> "And the feedback? *'Finally makes asking for help not awkward.'* *'I'd use this every day — especially during finals.'* *'The AI pricing is surprisingly accurate.'*"
>
> "This solves a real need. People feel it."

---

## SLIDE 8 — Why This Is Real (15 sec)

> "Let me be clear about something. **This is not a prototype.**"
>
> "Deployed at taskhero-sutd.web.app — live right now. **7 real-time Firestore streams** powering every screen. Built and shipped in **under 24 hours**. Zero infrastructure cost at current scale. And the **5% platform fee** is already baked into the codebase — monetization is live on day one."
>
> "We're not asking you to imagine what this could be. We're showing you what it **is**."

---

## SLIDE 9 — What's Next / Campus Domination (25 sec)

> "Here's the roadmap."
>
> "**Phase 1 — Polish.** Push notifications, in-app chat, reputation scores. The things that make users sticky."
>
> "**Phase 2 — Intelligence.** AI matching — recommending tasks to the right heroes based on location, skills, availability. Hyper-personalization."
>
> "**Phase 3 — Scale.** NUS. NTU. SMU. Every campus in Singapore. Same model, bigger network."
>
> "Revenue? **Transaction fees** on every task. **SaaS licences** for campus-wide access. **Premium AI tier** for power users. The business model scales with the user base."
>
> "From side gigs, to co-founder matching, to campus errands — Task Hero is the **structured layer** for the largest unmet need in student life: **micro-needs that nobody's building for.** Until now."

---

## CLOSING — (5 sec)

> **"Task Hero. Live. Deployed. Ready for every campus in Singapore."**
>
> "Thank you."

**[Hold. Don't rush off. Let it land.]**
