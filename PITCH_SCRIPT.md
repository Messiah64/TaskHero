# TaskHero — 2 Min Talk + 1 Min Demo Pitch Script

> **Format:** 2 min speaking (slides 1-4, then 5-9 after demo) + 1 min live demo after slide 4
> **Rule:** Every sentence either states a problem, proves a number, or closes a sale. No filler.

---

## SLIDE 1 — Title (10 sec)

**[Walk up. Don't introduce yourself. Start with the problem.]**

> "Right now, there are students on this campus who need food delivered, help with their code, a parcel picked up — and the only option they have is to spam a Telegram group and **hope** someone sees it."
>
> "We built the fix. It's live. You can open it right now."

---

## SLIDE 2 — The Problem (15 sec)

> "We surveyed **97 students** and **54 staff** on this campus."
>
> "**98%** of students said Telegram is overbloated for requests — messages get buried in minutes. **95%** of staff said they can't reach the right audience at all — emails go unread."
>
> "Campus micro-needs are **universal**. The infrastructure to serve them is **nonexistent**."

---

## SLIDE 3 — The Market (15 sec)

> "We ran the numbers. **Yesterday.** On this campus alone."
>
> "1,000 students. **670 pending micro-tasks** per week. That's over **$6,000 in latent demand every week** — just at SUTD."
>
> "Scale that to NUS, NTU, SMU — **40,000 students** — and you're looking at **$240K weekly** in unstructured campus demand that nobody is capturing."

---

## SLIDE 4 — The Solution (20 sec)

> "**Task Hero.** Powered by AI. Built for community."
>
> "**Post a task. A hero grabs it. They get paid. That's it.**"
>
> "What makes this different from everything else? Three things."
>
> "**One** — it handles every micro-need. Not just food, not just tutoring. Buy kopi. Find a co-founder. Sell your iPad. One platform."
>
> "**Two** — AI does the work. Speak your task into your phone — our AI structures it, prices it, categorises it in **10 seconds**."
>
> "**Three** — real-time tracking. Both parties see live progress. No chasing. No ghosting."
>
> "Let me show you."

## LIVE DEMO (60 sec)

**[Have taskhero-sutd.web.app pre-loaded and logged in. Phone mirrored to projector or laptop ready.]**

| Step | What You Do | What You Say | Time |
|------|------------|--------------|------|
| 1 | Show dashboard | "Logged in. Live dashboard — earnings, tasks, activity. All real-time." | 5s |
| 2 | Tap Post Task | "Let me create a task." | 2s |
| 3 | Tap Record mic | *Say: "Can someone buy me a chicken rice from the canteen, I'm in building 2 level 5"* | 8s |
| 4 | Tap Stop | "Deepgram transcribes it..." *(wait for text)* | 5s |
| 5 | Tap Format with AI | "GPT-4o-mini structures it..." *(wait for card)* | 8s |
| 6 | Show AI preview | "Title, category, location, suggested price — all generated. **10 seconds from voice to structured task.**" | 7s |
| 7 | Tap Post Task | "Posted. It's live on the marketplace right now." | 3s |
| 8 | Switch to Browse | "Every open task, filterable by category. Heroes pick what suits them." | 5s |
| 9 | Tap a task card | "Task detail — real-time progress tracker. Both poster and hero see this. Status updates instantly. No refresh." | 8s |
| 10 | Pause | "This is not a prototype. This is deployed. **Anyone in this room can open it right now.**" | 9s |

## SLIDE 5 — Product + Tech (10 sec)

> "Built entirely in **Flutter** — one codebase, runs on every device. Firebase Firestore for real-time data. OpenAI and Deepgram in production. Shipped in **under 24 hours**."

---

## SLIDE 6 — Why Not The Others (15 sec)

> "Why not Telegram? **No structure.** Your request drowns in 200 messages. No tracking, no accountability, no payment."
>
> "Why not Fiverr? Built for freelancers with portfolios, not a student who needs kopi in 10 minutes."
>
> "Why not Carousell? It's for **selling things**, not getting things done."
>
> "Task Hero is the only platform that **structures micro-needs, uses AI to remove friction, and tracks fulfillment in real-time** — built specifically for campus."

---

## SLIDE 7 — Validation (10 sec)

> "Voice to posted task: **under 10 seconds**. Top categories: Food, Academic Help, Errands — exactly what campuses need."
>
> "User feedback: *'Finally makes asking for help not awkward.'* *'I'd use this every day during finals.'*"

---

## SLIDE 8 — This Is Real (10 sec)

> "Deployed at taskhero-sutd.web.app. **7 real-time Firestore streams.** Zero infrastructure cost. **5% platform fee already in the codebase** — monetisation works from day one."
>
> "We're not pitching a vision. We're demoing a product."

---

## SLIDE 9 — Campus Domination (15 sec)

> "Phase 1 — polish. Notifications, chat, reputation system."
>
> "Phase 2 — intelligence. AI matches tasks to the right hero by location, skill, and availability."
>
> "Phase 3 — **scale**. NUS. NTU. SMU. Every campus in Singapore. Revenue from transaction fees, SaaS licences, and a premium AI tier."
>
> "From campus errands to side gigs to co-founder matching — **Task Hero is the structured layer for the largest unmet need in student life.** And it's live. Right now."

---

## CLOSING (5 sec)

> **"Task Hero. Deployed. Production-ready. And we're just getting started."**

**[Hold eye contact. Don't say thank you. Let it land.]**
